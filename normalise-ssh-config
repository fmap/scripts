#? Usage: normalise-ssh-config [<ssh_config>]
#?
#? This program reads a ssh_config(5)-formatted configuration file from
#? <ssh_config>, and reproduces its entries in ascending lexicographic order of
#? their Host/Match patterns. If <ssh_config> is not specified, it instead reads
#? from standard input. When multiple entries share a pattern, their declarations
#? are concatenated. Redundant declarations are removed, with precedence afforded
#? to the first to appear in the original file. Declarations prior to the first
#? Host or Match keyword are reproduced without manipulation.
#?
#? Given that the documentation of ssh_config(5) states:
#?
#? > Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more
#? > host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of
#? > the file, and general defaults at the end.
#?
#? This sorting is often insensible, but I've found this useful for working with
#? configurations that include only simple patterns.
